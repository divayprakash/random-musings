What do you do when you are angry?

And I don't mean like a little angry - like pouty-faced angry, or even shouting angry, or throwing things angry. I mean gut-wrenching, soul-crushing angry. So angry that it feels like hot lava burning up your insides and consuming you completely. Overwhelmingly and hopelessly angry, without any idea of what to do. Having not even the faintest idea of how to either control yourself, or to let the anger out. Scared that if you do let it out then it'll result in an episode after which you'll be left all alone. Knowing people get so scared of your anger that they all leave, every last one of them. And all that will be left with at the end is pain. The same gut-wrenching soul-crushing pain which leaves you unable to even sob.

I am angry. The same angry I just described. I don't know what to do.

Should I scream? No one cares enough to listen.
Should I cry? No one to console me.
Should I run? Where will I run to?
Should I break something? Does that really work?
Should I break myself? I used to do that, a long time ago. It's been over 9 years now that I've gone without doing that. But today, right now, this moment, I really want to do that.
