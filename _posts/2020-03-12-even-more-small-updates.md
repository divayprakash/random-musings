Continuing on with the small updates -

* Minified HTML - This made a HUGE difference. Like seriously huge, and unexpected to boot! I has not realized that it would be such a big deal. The site score on Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) tool went from 64 to 84 for mobile, while the desktop score 76 to a 99! Even more surprising was the fact that I was able to accomplish this using a plugin written completely in Liquid! A single `_layout` file was all it took. Check it out [here](http://jch.penibelst.de/).
* Removed animations - For some reason, the theme had `fadeIn` animations for the masthead image and text and a `dropIn` for the navigation bar. Just removed these because they seemed incoherent and not in touch with the rest of the page content.
* Optimized masthead logo image
* Minified CSS

Onwards to glory!
