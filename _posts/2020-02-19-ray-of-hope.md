Finally, a possibility of light at the end of the tunnel. Considering the pit of despair I am in at the moment, a shred of hope is better than nothing at all.

Browsing through some random forum[^1] gave me a possible solution - Netlify. Just as a thought exercise (and even though I am desperately trying not to get my hopes up too much), this seems quite plausible. Github isn't a hosting provider, Netlify is. So it makes sense that it supports a larger number of build pipelines and doesn't bind you to the same constraints as Github Pages.

To top it all off, Netlify even has a [post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/11/migrating-your-jekyll-site-to-netlify/) up on their blog with instructions on how to migrate a Jekyll site to their platform.

Fingers crossed this works! :crossed_fingers:

[^1]: maybe it was StackOverflow, or Jekyll forums, or a Github issue/PR, I don't even know at this point!
