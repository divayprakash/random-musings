At the point I [last posted]({{ page.previous.url | relative_url }}), I was just getting into exploring a new Jekyll theme for my blog. Now, after having sunk just over 3 days into the endeavour I find myself here, in abject misery.

An overview of the past few hours -

* It started simply enough, implementing a new theme. I remember saying to myself -
  <figure class="align-center"><img src="{{ '/assets/img/how-hard-can-it-be.jpg' | relative_url }}">
    <figcaption>Oh, how I'd regret that...</figcaption>
  </figure>
* And initially, it really wasn't. I had struggled through Jekyll, Liquid, and Textile long enough to know how to adapt the theme to my uses and add my own content.
* I had chosen to use the Ruby Gem based method of installing the theme; 'cause I thought having the theme gem installed would ease the process of development on my local machine which, as it turned out, was a correct assumption. So far this was what I had -

  ```ruby
  # Gemfile
  gem "jekyll-theme-so-simple"
  ```
  ```yaml
  # _config.yml
  theme: jekyll-theme-so-simple
  ```

* This worked perfectly, but as I was soon to find out, it only worked on my local machine. Github Pages does not support gem-based themes as it does not read Gemfiles at all! So when I pushed my work to a new repo, this was what I ended up with -

  ```console
  Your SCSS file `assets/css/main.scss` has an error on line 13: File to import
  not found or unreadable: so-simple. For more information, see
  https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/
  troubleshooting-jekyll-build-errors-for-github-pages-sites#invalid-sass-or-scss
  ```

  <figure class="align-center"><img src="{{ '/assets/img/are-you-kidding-me.png' | relative_url }}"></figure>

* Back to square 1 then. Digging into the details, I found that the only way to make sure I could have seamless theme updates (which I really wanted), was to use the `remote_theme` method which GitHub supported, now that the Gem based themed method had failed. And so the next commits removed the code above and added this -

  ```ruby
  # Gemfile
  gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
  group :jekyll_plugins do
  	gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
  end
  ```

  ```yaml
  # _config.yml
  remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"
  ```

* Just as an aside, I think the commit messages are worth a mention -

  ```console
  commit 363cc6961d2921ac1866b9e21c14450581e73b22
  Author: Divay Prakash <divayprakash0@gmail.com>

      Attempt to un-fuck Github Pages fuckery with Jekyll remote-theme; AGAIN
  
      Remove theme gem from Gemfile
  
  commit 5978bd4e828f72749e604e9fd8138ce27a322a32
  Author: Divay Prakash <divayprakash0@gmail.com>
  Date:   Mon Feb 17 19:19:55 2020 +0530
  
      Attempt to un-fuck Github Pages fuckery
  
      Replace Ruby Gem method of theme installation with Github Pages method
  ```

* Anyhow, now I have the `remote_theme` solution implemented. And wouldn't you know it, it's still fucked! It becomes so bad that at this point it just randomly errors out -

  ```console
  Conversion error: Jekyll::Converters::Scss encountered an error while
                    converting 'assets/css/main.scss':
                    File to import not found or unreadable: so-simple.
                    Load path: C:/Ruby25-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/
                    jekyll-theme-primer-0.5.4/_sass on line 13
  jekyll 3.8.5 | Error:  File to import not found or unreadable: so-simple.
  Load path: C:/Ruby25-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/jekyll-theme-primer-0.5.4/_sass
  on line 13
  ```

  All this because for some reason the `github-pages` gem's fallback theme is being used while `remote_theme` is ignored.

* Scouring StackOverflow, Jekyll forums, Github issues etc. gave me some possible solutions which I somehow patched together to get something working.
* But then I switched networks from using mobile hotspot to a stable WiFi and lo-and-behold, now `jekyll serve` fails randomly -

  ```console
  jekyll 3.8.5 | Error: Net::ReadTimeout
  ```

  I get that my Internet connectivity is to blame for this, but really? To top it all off, the `jekyll-remote-theme` gem that enables all this functionality doesn't support caching between command invocations, but only between builds (the feature is [WIP](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme/pull/56) for now). So every time something like a `jekyll serve` or a `jekyll build` runs, it downloads the theme again. Even when it works, it takes too long; over 40s to download a ~800kB zip file.

* Where does all this leave me?
  * Option 1 - Gem based theme
    Works perfectly on local machine, doesn't work on Github Pages
  * Option 2 - `remote_theme` using `github-pages` gem
    Works on Github Pages, but flaky on local machine at the best of times
* Where do I go from here?
