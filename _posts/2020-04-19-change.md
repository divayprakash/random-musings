As is popularly said, change is inevitable. Somehow, I always understood this, and took it to heart. I adapted it into my own adage -

Well, not always. I sometimes think life hasn't been particularly kind to me, but I'm very aware of the fact that a vast number of people in the world lead lives which are much more difficult. Believe me, I am grateful for all that I have. Then again, the mere fact that there are people in the world who lead a lesser life or are less fortunate to me in some way, doesn't mean that I should feel guilty about my feelings. No one is living my life but myself. What I face, whatever it may be, big or small as it may be for someone else, only I have to live through it.

So there. I am not going to feel sorry about the way I feel. I am not going to downplay things just because they may be trivial for other people. And in a certain way, that is really liberating. It gives me the freedom to just let myself go for once...

Also, just an FYI, I think this isn't really a blog, so much as it is a journal. These posts, though written as if for an audience, are more for myself. So, I'm looking for way to restrict access to this so-called 'blog' so it can't be viewed be someone with the link also.
