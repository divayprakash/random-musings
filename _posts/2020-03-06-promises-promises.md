I made a promise to myself to stop wasting time watching random shit on Youtube and instead use that time to read something or blog or just do anything else more productive. A progress report - I'm doing better... *sort of*.

Why only "sort of"? Well, I haven't done as much of the other stuff as I wanted to. THe past few days got surprisingly busy with something or the other coming up just randomly all over the place. I met an old colleague on the 2nd so there went a day. The 3rd saw me preparing for a stupid viva for school and then 4th went into the stupid viva itself and studying (well, teaching rather) for a test on the 5th. Of course, 5th then went into the test itself and the rest of the day spent in playing pool and going out for drinks with a friend who'd fallen by the wayside (nope, that's not correct, make it - "a friend who'd forgotten me by the wayside").

And that brings me on to 'promises promises.' It just happens so often doesn't it? We promise ourselves or someone else something or the other, and then somehow it just does not work out that way. Why is it? Why are we as humans so unable to keep our promises that we disappoint ourselves or someone close to us so often? I don't know the answer to that one either, but I have a theory. It goes like this - humans are inherently deceptive. We deceive ourselves and others around us all the time! According to my theory, it's all down to two factors -

* Conscious conditioning - Consider as an example any primary school event. Everyone is a winner. There are no prizes for coming first or putting in any special effort. Why? It's done in the name of not discouraging any single child. However, children are not stupid. THey know winners from losers. And whatever else this policy does or doesn't, it shows children the willingness of the adults around them to deceive, to lie. This isn't just restricted to school, you can see it pretty much anywhere

* Hope -

  I do believe this applies here. Hope is something we humans always seem to have just a little more of. However dire the situation may be, we still hope. We even have a phrase for it - "hope against all hope"! This drives us to say things we are not sure of and make promises we know we may not be able to keep.

The culmination of all this results in the lies we utter everyday and the promises we make knowing full well we won't be able to keep them. My friend promised me to always have space for me in her life, and of course she couldn't keep it. I promised myself not to feel bad about it when it (eventually) fell through but I did. And so on it goes.

What to do about this? Fair question, but there is no real answer. Well, there is, but it requires a lot of effort - introspection. Thinking about what we say before we say it. Understanding the meaning in our own words, whether they be addressed to ourselves or to someone else. This is paramount. Only then can we begin to make a change.

I guess I don't really have a simple conclusion here. Philosophy gives me a headache sometimes.
